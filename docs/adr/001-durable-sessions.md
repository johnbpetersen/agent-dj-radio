# ADR 001: Durable Session-Based Identity

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Authors:** Claude Code
**Related Migration:** `012_durable_sessions.sql`

## Context

Previously, guest user identity was implicitly tied to the `presence` table, which has a short TTL (~5 minutes). When presence expired, the same browser cookie would create a **duplicate user** on the next request because there was no durable mapping from `session_id` (cookie value) to `user_id`.

This caused poor UX:
- Users lost their identity between visits
- Chat history was fragmented across duplicate user accounts
- Session cookies were technically 30-day but practically ephemeral due to presence TTL gating

**Key constraint:** Discord OAuth has been fully removed. Identity must now be cookie-based only, with no external providers in this phase.

## Decision

We introduce a **durable sessions table** as the authoritative source of session‚Üíuser identity mappings:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.sessions (
  session_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,          -- Client cookie value
  user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  last_seen_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Key Principles

1. **Source of Truth:** The `sessions` table is the **only** source of identity. Presence is ephemeral metadata only.
2. **Idempotent Requests:** `/api/session/hello` can be called repeatedly with the same cookie and will always return the same `user_id`.
3. **Presence Never Queried for Identity:** When `sid` cookie exists, we lookup `sessions` table first. Presence is upserted (write-only from identity perspective).
4. **30-Day Durability:** Sessions persist for 30 days (cookie `Max-Age`). Identity survives presence expiry and browser closures.

## Implementation

### Cookie Contract

- Name: `sid` (session ID)
- Value: UUIDv4 (generated via `generateCorrelationId()`)
- Attributes: `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Secure (HTTPS only); Path=/; Max-Age=2592000` (30 days)
- Set once per new session; not refreshed on every request

### Request Flow (`ensureSession()`)

```typescript
// api/_shared/session-helpers.ts : ensureSession()

1. Extract sid from cookie or X-Session-Id header
2. Validate sid is valid UUIDv4 (reject malformed)

3. IF sid exists:
   a. Lookup sessions table: SELECT user_id FROM sessions WHERE session_id = sid
   b. IF found:
      - Update sessions.last_seen_at = now()
      - Fetch users.display_name
      - UPSERT presence (ephemeral, NOT read for identity)
      - Return { userId, sessionId, shouldSetCookie: false }
   c. IF NOT found (session mapping lost):
      - Log WARNING: "session-mapping-missing"
      - Fall through to create new user (cannot recover old identity)

4. IF no sid OR sid invalid OR session not found:
   a. Generate new sid (or reuse orphaned sid if present)
   b. Create new guest user with collision-safe name (createGuestUserWithUniqueName)
   c. INSERT INTO sessions (session_id, user_id, created_at, last_seen_at)
   d. UPSERT presence
   e. Return { userId, sessionId, shouldSetCookie: true }
```

### Race Safety

**Concurrent first requests:**
If two requests with the same new `sid` race:
- First insert wins (PK constraint on `session_id`)
- Second insert gets `23505` error ‚Üí reads winning row ‚Üí uses winner's `user_id`
- Both requests converge to same `user_id` (no duplicate users)

**Presence expiry:**
- Does NOT affect identity (sessions table remains intact)
- Presence is recreated on next `/api/session/hello` call

### Migration Strategy

**Forward:**
```sql
-- Create sessions table with indexes
-- Enable RLS (no policies - service-role only)
```

**Rollback:**
```sql
-- Drop sessions table
-- Revert api_handlers/session/hello.ts to use presence-based identity
```

## Consequences

### Positive

‚úÖ **Persistent Guest Identity:** Users keep the same ID across visits (30-day window)
‚úÖ **Simpler Identity Model:** Single source of truth (sessions table), not derived from presence TTL
‚úÖ **Better UX:** Chat messages, reactions, and user state persist across sessions
‚úÖ **Explicit Lifecycle:** Sessions have clear created_at/last_seen_at timestamps for cleanup
‚úÖ **Future-Ready:** Foundation for wallet linking (flip `ephemeral` flag on link)

### Negative

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Loss Scenario:** If `sessions` row is deleted but cookie persists, old identity is **unrecoverable** (new guest user created)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Orphaned Users:** If user clears cookies frequently, may accumulate stale guest users (mitigated by cleanup job based on `last_seen_at`)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Storage Cost:** Small increase (~50 bytes/session √ó active users)

### Neutral

üîπ **No Behavioral Change for New Users:** First-visit flow identical
üîπ **No New Required Env Vars:** Uses existing Supabase service role
üîπ **Backward Incompatible with Old Cookies:** Pre-migration cookies with no `sessions` mapping will create new users (acceptable for early beta)

## Testing

**Unit Tests:** `tests/api/session/durable-identity.test.ts`
- Scenario 1: New visitor ‚Üí creates user + session + cookie
- Scenario 2: Existing cookie after presence expiry ‚Üí SAME `user_id` (key invariant)
- Scenario 3: Orphaned cookie (no session row) ‚Üí new user + warning
- Edge: Invalid UUID ‚Üí treated as missing
- Edge: Concurrent inserts ‚Üí no duplicate users

**Smoke Test:** `scripts/smoke-sessions.sh` (manual verification)

## Alternatives Considered

**A1: Keep presence as identity source, increase TTL**
‚ùå Rejected: Doesn't solve fundamental issue (still expires), just delays it

**A2: Store session‚Üíuser mapping in cookie value**
‚ùå Rejected: Cookies are client-controlled, not trustworthy for identity binding

**A3: Use Supabase Auth with anonymous users**
‚ùå Rejected: Adds dependency, overkill for simple guest sessions

## Future Work

- **Session Cleanup Job:** Delete `sessions` where `last_seen_at < now() - interval '30 days'`
- **User Cleanup Job:** Delete `users` where `ephemeral = true AND id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM sessions)`
- **Wallet Linking:** When user links wallet, flip `users.ephemeral = false` and bind via `user_accounts` table
- **Session Analytics:** Track session duration, return visit rate via `created_at` / `last_seen_at`
