# Development Status & Next Steps

## Project Status
- **Backend Status:** âœ… COMPLETE (AI music generation working!)
- **Local Development:** âœ… COMPLETE (Real Supabase integration working!)
- **Current Phase:** Production Deployment & User Testing
- **Goal:** Deploy to production and begin live user testing

---

## âœ… COMPLETED: Local Development Setup

### ðŸŽµ Development Server Integration
- [x] **Fixed Local API Integration**
  - [x] Created `dev-functions-server.ts` for local API serving
  - [x] Fixed Vite proxy configuration to point to real functions (not mock server)
  - [x] Real Supabase database connection in development
  - [x] Automatic track queue bootstrapping on startup

- [x] **Station/Queue API Working**
  - [x] Station state endpoint returns real database tracks  
  - [x] Queue populated with actual Supabase data
  - [x] Automatic current track selection (first available â†’ PLAYING)
  - [x] Proper track status handling (READY, GENERATING, PAID)

### ðŸ”§ Development Experience Improvements
- [x] **No Vercel CLI Required**: `npm run dev` starts everything locally
- [x] **Real Database Integration**: Development uses live Supabase data
- [x] **ESM Import Compatibility**: TypeScript imports work correctly in dev
- [x] **Environment Variable Loading**: Automatic `.env.local` loading via dotenv

## âœ… COMPLETED: Ephemeral User Management (Alpha) - 2025-09-11

### Database Migrations âœ…
- [x] Create ephemeral users migration (001_ephemeral_users.sql)
- [x] Create presence table migration (002_presence.sql)  
- [x] Create chat messages table migration (003_chat_messages.sql)
- [x] Create cleanup procedures migration (004_cleanup_procedures.sql)

### Shared Utilities âœ…
- [x] Create session ID helper (api/_shared/session.ts)
- [x] Create fun name generator (src/lib/name-generator.ts)
- [x] Create profanity filter (src/lib/profanity.ts)
- [x] Extend rate limiting (src/server/rate-limit.ts)

### API Endpoints âœ…
- [x] POST /api/session/hello - Create/retrieve ephemeral user + presence
- [x] POST /api/presence/ping - Keep presence alive  
- [x] GET /api/users/active - Get active users list
- [x] POST /api/users/rename - Change display name
- [x] POST /api/users/bio - Set user bio
- [x] POST /api/chat/post - Post chat message (behind ENABLE_CHAT_ALPHA flag)
- [x] GET /api/chat/recent - Get recent chat messages (behind ENABLE_CHAT_ALPHA flag)
- [x] POST /api/worker/cleanup-ephemeral - Background cleanup job

### Frontend Components âœ… 
- [x] Create useEphemeralUser hook (src/hooks/useEphemeralUser.ts)
- [x] Create ActiveListeners component (src/components/ActiveListeners.tsx)
- [x] Create ProfileDrawer component (src/components/ProfileDrawer.tsx)
- [x] Create ChatBox component (src/components/ChatBox.tsx) - behind ENABLE_CHAT_ALPHA flag
- [x] Update SubmitForm.tsx to use useEphemeralUser hook

### Integration & Testing âœ…
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] Rate limiting implemented and tested
- [x] Validation and error handling implemented
- [x] Track submission integration completed
- [x] Manual test script created (./test-ephemeral-users.sh)

### Documentation âœ…
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive ephemeral user documentation
- [x] Added deployment notes for new environment variables

**Sprint Summary:** Successfully implemented complete ephemeral user management system with session-based authentication, presence tracking, real-time active users, profile editing, optional chat, rate limiting, validation, and automatic cleanup. All code passes TypeScript compilation and follows security best practices.
