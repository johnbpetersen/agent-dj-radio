# Front-End Player & Experience TODO

## Project Status
- **Backend Status:** âœ… COMPLETE (AI music generation working!)
- **Current Phase:** Front-End Player Experience
- **Goal:** Get real AI tracks playing through fully functional UI

---

## PHASE 1: Core Music Player (PRIORITY 1)

### ðŸŽµ Audio Playback
- [ ] **Investigate Layout/NowPlaying Components**
  - [ ] Find current audio implementation in Layout component
  - [ ] Identify how audio player is structured
  - [ ] Test with sample URLs to verify functionality

- [ ] **Connect to Real Audio URLs**
  - [ ] Connect player to station state API
  - [ ] Use real Supabase Storage URLs from generated tracks
  - [ ] Test playback with your 2 generated AI tracks
  - [ ] Fix progress bar and time display
  - [ ] Ensure player controls (play/pause/skip) work

### ðŸ”— Station API Integration
- [ ] **Debug Station/Queue APIs**
  - [ ] Fix station state endpoint (currently returning errors)
  - [ ] Fix queue endpoint to return real database tracks
  - [ ] Test API responses with real track data
  - [ ] Ensure proper track status handling (READY, GENERATING, PAID)

---

## PHASE 2: Queue & Real Data (PRIORITY 2)

### ðŸ§¹ Mock Data Cleanup  
- [ ] **Remove Mock/Placeholder Code**
  - [ ] Replace mock user ID in SubmitForm component
  - [ ] Clean up any "dummy", "mock", or "placeholder" references
  - [ ] Connect QueueList to real database tracks

### âš¡ Real-time Updates
- [ ] **Supabase Realtime Integration**
  - [ ] Test real-time queue updates
  - [ ] Show live track generation progress
  - [ ] Update UI when tracks change status

---

## PHASE 3: Rating System (PRIORITY 3)

### ðŸŒŸ Track Rating
- [ ] **Backend Rating API**
  - [ ] Create `POST /api/tracks/[id]/rate` endpoint
  - [ ] Add rating columns to tracks database table
  - [ ] Handle rating persistence and retrieval

- [ ] **Frontend Rating UI**
  - [ ] Connect Reactions component to rating API
  - [ ] Add visual feedback for rating selection
  - [ ] Show track ratings in queue display

---

## PHASE 4: Polish & Testing (PRIORITY 4)

### ðŸŽ® User Experience
- [ ] **Full Integration Testing**
  - [ ] Test complete flow: submit â†’ generate â†’ queue â†’ play
  - [ ] Verify smooth track transitions
  - [ ] Test on mobile and desktop
  - [ ] Polish UI responsiveness

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Handle audio loading failures gracefully
  - [ ] Show proper loading states during generation
  - [ ] Display helpful error messages

---

## COMPLETED: Backend AI Music Pipeline âœ…

### Music Generation (Working!)
- [x] ElevenLabs API integration with real credits
- [x] Instrumental-only track generation
- [x] Prompt length handling and truncation
- [x] Supabase Storage integration
- [x] Worker queue processing
- [x] Fallback system for API failures

### Infrastructure
- [x] Database schema with track states
- [x] Real-time subscriptions setup
- [x] Security and rate limiting
- [x] Health monitoring system

**Current Status:** Backend is pumping out real AI beats! Now let's get the front-end jamming along. ðŸŽµðŸ”¥

**Next Step:** Start Phase 1 by investigating the current audio player implementation.
