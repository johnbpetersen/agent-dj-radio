# Development Status & Next Steps

## Project Status
- **Backend Status:** âœ… COMPLETE (AI music generation working!)
- **Local Development:** âœ… COMPLETE (Real Supabase integration working!)
- **Current Phase:** Production Deployment & User Testing
- **Goal:** Deploy to production and begin live user testing

---

## âœ… COMPLETED: Local Development Setup

### ðŸŽµ Development Server Integration
- [x] **Fixed Local API Integration**
  - [x] Created `dev-functions-server.ts` for local API serving
  - [x] Fixed Vite proxy configuration to point to real functions (not mock server)
  - [x] Real Supabase database connection in development
  - [x] Automatic track queue bootstrapping on startup

- [x] **Station/Queue API Working**
  - [x] Station state endpoint returns real database tracks  
  - [x] Queue populated with actual Supabase data
  - [x] Automatic current track selection (first available â†’ PLAYING)
  - [x] Proper track status handling (READY, GENERATING, PAID)

### ðŸ”§ Development Experience Improvements
- [x] **No Vercel CLI Required**: `npm run dev` starts everything locally
- [x] **Real Database Integration**: Development uses live Supabase data
- [x] **ESM Import Compatibility**: TypeScript imports work correctly in dev
- [x] **Environment Variable Loading**: Automatic `.env.local` loading via dotenv

## PHASE 1: Production Deployment (PRIORITY 1)

### ðŸš€ Vercel Production Setup
- [ ] **Environment Configuration**
  - [ ] Set up production Vercel project  
  - [ ] Configure production environment variables
  - [ ] Set feature flags: `ENABLE_REAL_ELEVEN=true`, `ENABLE_X402=false` (initially)
  - [ ] Configure ADMIN_TOKEN for production monitoring

- [ ] **API Key Integration**
  - [ ] Set up real ElevenLabs API key
  - [ ] Configure Coinbase CDP for x402 payments (testnet first)
  - [ ] Test API integrations in staging environment

### ðŸ§¹ Frontend Polish
- [ ] **User Experience**
  - [ ] Test complete flow: submit â†’ generate â†’ queue â†’ play
  - [ ] Verify smooth track transitions with real AI tracks
  - [ ] Test on mobile and desktop devices
  - [ ] Polish loading states during track generation

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Handle audio loading failures gracefully
  - [ ] Show proper loading states during generation
  - [ ] Display helpful error messages for payment failures

---

## PHASE 2: User Testing & Validation (PRIORITY 2)

### ðŸ‘¥ Alpha Testing
- [ ] **Internal Testing**
  - [ ] Test with real ElevenLabs music generation
  - [ ] Verify track quality and generation speed
  - [ ] Test concurrent users (use `test-concurrent-submissions.js`)
  - [ ] Validate health monitoring at `/api/health`

- [ ] **Beta User Testing**
  - [ ] Invite limited beta users for feedback
  - [ ] Monitor system performance under real load
  - [ ] Collect feedback on music quality and UI/UX
  - [ ] Iterate based on user feedback

---

## PHASE 3: Production Launch (PRIORITY 3)

### ðŸ”¥ Live Launch
- [ ] **Final Production Setup**
  - [ ] Enable full feature flags: `ENABLE_REAL_ELEVEN=true`, `ENABLE_X402=true`
  - [ ] Switch from Base-Sepolia testnet to Base mainnet  
  - [ ] Configure production monitoring and alerting
  - [ ] Set up customer support processes

### ðŸ“Š Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] **Analytics & Monitoring**
  - [ ] Monitor health dashboard and system metrics
  - [ ] Track user engagement and music generation success rates
  - [ ] Analyze payment conversion rates and user behavior
  - [ ] Plan feature improvements based on usage data

---

## COMPLETED: Backend AI Music Pipeline âœ…

### Music Generation (Working!)
- [x] ElevenLabs API integration with real credits
- [x] Instrumental-only track generation
- [x] Prompt length handling and truncation
- [x] Supabase Storage integration
- [x] Worker queue processing
- [x] Fallback system for API failures

### Infrastructure
- [x] Database schema with track states
- [x] Real-time subscriptions setup
- [x] Security and rate limiting
- [x] Health monitoring system

**Current Status:** Local development is fully working with real Supabase integration! The queue auto-populates with your database tracks and the station bootstraps automatically. ðŸš€

**Next Step:** Deploy to production and begin user testing with real AI music generation.
