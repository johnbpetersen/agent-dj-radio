  - [ ] Set `X402_CHAIN` to "base-sepolia" or "base"
  - [ ] Test blockchain connectivity

- [ ] **Supabase Production Configuration**
  - [ ] Create production Supabase project (or use existing)

  - [ ] Configure production `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - [ ] Set up Supabase Storage bucket for audio files
  - [ ] Test database connectivity and RLS policies

### 🌐 Deployment Environment
- [ ] **Vercel Production Deployment**
  - [ ] Set all production environment variables in Vercel dashboard
  - [ ] Set `VITE_SITE_URL` to production domain
  - [ ] Configure `ADMIN_TOKEN` with secure random value
  - [ ] Enable `ENABLE_REAL_ELEVEN=true` and `ENABLE_X402=true`
  - [ ] Deploy and verify health check passes

- [ ] **Domain & Security**
  - [ ] Configure custom domain (if applicable)
  - [ ] Update CORS `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `api/_shared/security.ts`
  - [ ] Test CORS policy with production domain
  - [ ] Verify SSL certificate is working

## PHASE 2: System Validation & Testing

### 🏥 Health & Monitoring Verification
- [ ] **Health Dashboard Validation**
  - [ ] Access `/api/health` endpoint
  - [ ] Verify all services show "up" status (database, ElevenLabs, storage)
  - [ ] Confirm feature flags show as enabled
  - [ ] Check system metrics are populated correctly

- [ ] **Admin Panel Testing**
  - [ ] Access admin panel with `/?admin=1`
  - [ ] Enter production `ADMIN_TOKEN`
  - [ ] Verify health dashboard loads in admin interface
  - [ ] Test manual station advance functionality
  - [ ] Test manual track generation trigger

### 🧪 End-to-End Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Music Generation Pipeline**
  - [ ] Submit test track via UI (should get 402 Payment Required)
  - [ ] Complete payment flow with test transaction
  - [ ] Verify track moves to PAID status
  - [ ] Confirm track generation begins (status: GENERATING)
  - [ ] Wait for generation completion (status: READY)
  - [ ] Verify audio file is created and playable
  - [ ] Check track appears in queue

- [ ] **Station Playback**
  - [ ] Verify station automatically picks up new tracks
  - [ ] Check playhead timing is accurate
  - [ ] Test station advance (automatic and manual)
  - [ ] Verify real-time updates across multiple browser tabs
  - [ ] Test track completion and queue progression

- [ ] **Payment System**
  - [ ] Test payment flow with different amounts (60s, 90s, 120s tracks)
  - [ ] Verify payment verification works correctly
  - [ ] Test payment failures and error handling
  - [ ] Check payment audit trail in database
  - [ ] Test idempotency (same payment multiple times)

### 🚀 Load Testing
- [ ] **Concurrent User Testing**
  - [ ] Run `node test-concurrent-submissions.js` with production environment
  - [ ] Test with 5 concurrent users (default)
  - [ ] Increase to 10+ concurrent users if system handles well
  - [ ] Monitor health dashboard during load tests
  - [ ] Check rate limiting behavior under load
  - [ ] Verify database performance under concurrent writes

---

## PHASE 3: User Acceptance Testing

### 👥 Real User Testing
- [ ] **Alpha Testing (Internal)**
  - [ ] Invite 3-5 internal users for testing
  - [ ] Provide test USDC for payments (Base Sepolia)
  - [ ] Collect feedback on user experience
  - [ ] Document any bugs or issues found
  - [ ] Test on different devices (mobile, desktop)
  - [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

- [ ] **Beta Testing (External)**
  - [ ] Invite 10-20 external users for beta testing
  - [ ] Provide clear instructions and test funds
  - [ ] Set up feedback collection system
  - [ ] Monitor system performance during beta
  - [ ] Track user engagement metrics
  - [ ] Document all issues and feature requests

### 📊 Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] **Usage Metrics**
  - [ ] Track track submissions per hour/day
  - [ ] Monitor generation success rates (target >90%)
  - [ ] Track payment conversion rates (target >90%)
  - [ ] Monitor user retention and return usage
  - [ ] Track system performance metrics

- [ ] **Error Monitoring**
  - [ ] Monitor error rates across all endpoints
  - [ ] Set up alerts for critical errors
  - [ ] Track API timeouts and failures
  - [ ] Monitor blockchain payment failures
  - [ ] Track music generation failures
